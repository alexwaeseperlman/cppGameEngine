## ARCHIVED: I wrote this when I was 15. It will never be useful for anything, but I learned a lot!

### What is this?
I started work on a 2d game engine as a way to practice my opengl and c++ skills. I never finished it but I enjoyed the whole process and learned a ton.

### Installation
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/squishybanana04/cppGameEngine.git
mkdir bin
cd bin
cmake ..
make
./Renderer
```
